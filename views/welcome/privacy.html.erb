      <h1>CardinalHire's Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><small>Date of last revision: January 23, 2018</small></p>
      <p>1 Introduction</p>
      <p>1.1 Questions. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, contact our privacy team through this <%= link_to 'contact page', welcome_contact_path %>.</p>
      <p>1.2 Scope. This privacy policy covers all of CardinalHire. By using or accessing the Site, you agree to our privacy practices outlined in this document.  This privacy policy does not apply to entities that CardinalHire does not own or control.  Nor does it apply to websites that post different statements.</p>
      <p>1.3 No Information from Persons under Age 18. If you are under age 18, please do not attempt to register for our Site or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a person under age 18, we will delete that information. If you believe that we might have any information from a person under age 18, please contact us via our <%= link_to 'contact page', welcome_contact_path %>.</p>
      <p>1.4 Revisions or Changes to the Privacy Policy. This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. We reserve the right to make changes at any time, effective upon posting an updated version of the privacy statement within the TOS on our Site.  We will notify you of any material change to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on our Site's homepage for a reasonable period and by changing the effective date, which is located at the top of the privacy policy.</p>
      <p>2 Information and Data We Receive</p>
      <p>2.1 Information You Give Us.</p>
      <p>2.1.1 Account Information. When you sign up for the Site and supply your profile, you provide us with certain information.  Examples include your name, email address, password, gender, birthdate, and personally identifiable information to identify and/or contact you and to interact with you. What is requested depends upon whether you are a job seeker, a recruiter, or an employer and the expected interaction. You may be able to add a picture of yourself. In some cases, we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you.</p>
      <p>2.1.2 User Content. Some Content you upload to our Site may include metadata. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with Content you upload to the Site (e.g., photos), remove the metadata before uploading the Content.  Our ability to capture and analyze certain metadata allows us to improve our services and provide additional features and functionality.</p>
      <p>2.1.3 Transactional Data. We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on the Site.</p>
      <p>2.2 Data We Collect when You Interact with CardinalHire.</p>
      <p>2.2.1 Site Activity Data. We keep track of some of the actions you take on the Site. We may use third-party applications to collect and analyze this information.  In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide information or Content to us. For example, if you upload a position description or candidate information, in addition to storing the actual Content you uploaded, we might log the fact that you uploaded it. Our ability to obtain information about the users of our services allows us to improve our services.</p>
      <p>2.2.2 Access Device and Browser Data. When you access the Site, we may collect data from the accessing computer, phone, or other device about the type of device employed, screen display information, your browser type and version, browser language, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit, how long you spent on a page, access times, and other information about your use of and actions on our Site.  Our use of device-related and browser-related information allows us to personalize and improve our services.</p>
      <p>2.2.3 Cookie Data. We and third parties may use "cookies" (small pieces of data that store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other accessing device) to make the Site easier to use, to make our advertising better, to personalize and improve our services, and to protect both you and CardinalHire. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to the Site. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into the Site, and to know when you are interacting with our CardinalHire platform applications and websites, our widgets, and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may affect your ability to use the Site fully, properly, or at all.</p>
      <p>2.2.4 Web Beacons. We may log information using digital images called Web beacons on our Site or in our emails. We may use Web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn what marketing works and what does not. Â We may also use Web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails.</p>
      <p>2.3 Data We Receive from Third Parties.</p>
      <p>2.3.1 Data from Other Websites. We may institute programs with advertising partners and other Internet websites in which they share data with us to allow us to personalize and improve our services.</p>
      <p>2.3.1.1 We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and, for comparison purposes, how other users who didn't see the ads acted on their website). This data sharing, commonly known as "conversion tracking," helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see.</p>
      <p>2.3.1.2 We may receive data about whether or not you've seen or interacted with certain ads on other Internet websites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.</p>
      <p>2.3.1.3 If in any of these cases we receive data that we do not already have, we may "anonymize" it, meaning we take measures at our discretion intended to preclude association of the information with any particular user. If we institute these programs, we may use the data in the ways we explain in the "How We Use Your Information" section below.</p>
      <p>2.3.2 Information from Other Users. We may collect information about you from other Users of our Site to allow us to personalize and improve our services.</p>
      <p>2.3.3 Information from Other Sources.  We may get information about you from other sources. We may add this to information we get from this Site to allow us to personalize and improve our services.</p>
      <p>3 Sharing Information on CardinalHire</p>
      <p>This section explains how your how your information is shared on the Site.</p>
      <p>3.1 Name and Profile Picture. Our Site is designed to make it easy to find and connect users. If you are uncomfortable with sharing your profile picture, you should delete it (or not add one), but this may materially diminish the benefit of the Site for you.</p>
      <p>3.2 Contact Information. Your contact information, such as your email and phone number(s), facilitates persons who wish to contact you. None of this information is required except for your email address.</p>
      <p>3.3 Personal Information. Personal information, such as your birthdate, is not provided to other parties as directly associated with you. We may, however, provide aggregate information about the profile of our users as a whole, which includes ages.</p>
      <p>3.4 Gender and Birth Date. In addition to name and email address, we require you to provide your gender and birthdate during the registration process. We want to understand better the user demographics so that we may personalize and improve our services.  Another reason we require your date of birth is to verify that you are 18 years of age or older.</p>
      <p>3.5 Public Information. In general, information you publish on the CardinalHire Site is publicly available information, such as your name and profile picture in a blog or discussion forum. We may, at our discretion, limit access to that information to certain groups, e.g., instructors, participants in a class, recruiters, employers, job seekers, or other group. Public information may, for example, be accessed by everyone on the Internet (including people not logged into the Site), be indexed by third-party search engines, and be imported, exported, distributed, and redistributed by us and others without privacy limitations. Such information may also be associated with you, including your name and profile picture, even outside of our Site, such as on public search engines and when you visit other websites on the Internet.</p>
      <p>3.6 Minors. Users of the CardinalHire Site must be of 18 years of age of older. Users agree not to post any information related to persons under the age of 18.</p>
      <p>3.7 Other Guides.</p>
      <p>3.7.1 Even after you remove information or Content from your profile or delete your account, copies of that data may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed, or it was copied or stored for archive or backup purposes or by other users.</p>
      <p>3.7.2 You understand that information and Content might be re-shared or copied by other users.</p>
      <p>3.7.3 Certain types of communications that you send to other users may not be removable, such as delivered messages.</p>
      <p>3.7.4 If you use an external source to publish information to the Site (such as a mobile application), you should determine and evaluate the privacy controls followed by that external source.</p>
      <p>3.7.5 We make no assurances that any party will respond to do-not-track signals from web browsers.  As stated elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, your activities may be tracked by us and third parties for many purposes, including how to target and improve services.</p>
      <p>4 Information You Share with Third Parties</p>
      <p>4.1 Third-Party Websites. In order to provide you with useful experiences via the Site, we may provide general information about you to third-party Internet websites at the time you visit them (if you are still logged in to our Site).</p>
      <p>4.2 Exporting Information. You (and those to whom you make your information available) may use tools like RSS feeds, mobile-phone address-book applications, or copy-and-paste functions, to capture, export, (and in some cases, import) information from our Site, including your information and information about you.</p>
      <p>4.3 Advertisements. Should advertisers present ads on the Site, they may sometimes use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. You may use your browser's cookie settings to limit or prevent the placement of cookies by advertising networks. We do not share personally identifiable information with advertisers unless we get your permission.</p>
      <p>4.4 Links. When you click on links on the Site, you may leave our Site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other Internet websites. We encourage you to read the respective privacy statements.</p>
      <p>5 How We Use Your Information</p>
      <p>We use the information we collect for many purposes, including to communicate with you and to enhance the services and experience on the Site. We try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:</p>
      <p>5.1 To Manage the Site's Services. We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our TOS. We may use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse, such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.</p>
      <p>5.2 To Contact You. We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time.</p>
      <p>5.3 To Serve Personalized Advertising to You. We don't share your personally identifiable information with advertisers without your consent. We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements. We may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements.  Even though we do not share your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the desired criteria.</p>
      <p>5.4 To Serve Ads. We may pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you to make advertisements more interesting and more tailored to you.</p>
      <p>5.5 To Supplement Your Profile. We may use information about you that we collect from other Site users to supplement your profile.</p>
      <p>5.6 Downloadable Software. Certain downloadable software applications and applets that we may offer may transmit data to us. We may not make a formal disclosure if we believe our collection of and use of the information is the obvious purpose of the application. If we believe it is not obvious that we are collecting or using such information, we will make a disclosure to you the first time you provide the information to us so that you can decide whether you want to use that feature.</p>
      <p>6 How We Share Information</p>
      <p>CardinalHire is about creating a successful experience. We share your information with other parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, other parties' services and/or products, or when legally required to do so. For example:</p>
      <p>6.1 When You Make a Payment. When you enter into payment transactions, we do not ask you for your credit-card number or other billing information.  We do not receive that information.  After you provide the information to authorize a purchase from CardinalHire, you would connect to PayPal, make payment through PayPal, and you will be subject to PayPalâs privacy policy.</p>
      <p>6.2 When You Invite Others to Join. If you invite others to join our Site, we may send the other party a message on your behalf using your name. The invitation may also contain information about other users the party might know.</p>
      <p>6.3 When You Choose to Share Your Information with Marketers. You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic-commerce providers that are not associated with CardinalHire through on-Site offers. This is entirely at your discretion, and we will not provide your personally identifiable information to these marketers without your consent.</p>
      <p>6.4 To Give Search Engines Access to Publicly Available Information. We generally allow search engines access to our Site.</p>
      <p>6.5 To Help Improve or Promote Our Services. We may share aggregated information with third parties to help improve or promote our services, but only in such a way that we believe no individual user will be identified or linked to any specific action or information.</p>
      <p>6.6 To Provide You with Services. We may provide information to service providers, consultants, and other agents that help us bring you the services we offer and to improve those services. For example, we may use third parties to help host our Site, send out email updates about CardinalHire, remove repetitive information from our user lists, process payments, provide search results or links (including sponsored links), detect, prevent, or address fraud, or to audit, maintain, or improve the technology, operations, or security of the Site. These service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the services.</p>
      <p>6.7 To Advertise our Services. We may ask advertisers outside of CardinalHire to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.</p>
      <p>6.8 To Offer Joint Services. We may provide services jointly with other companies. If you use these services, we may share your information to facilitate those services. We will identify the partner and present the joint-service-provider's privacy policy to you before you use the respective services.</p>
      <p>6.9 To Respond to Legal Requests and Prevent Harm. We may disclose information and Content pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, applies to users from that jurisdiction, and is consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information and Content when we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our TOS. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts, or other government entities.</p>
      <p>6.10 Business Deal.  We may share personal information when we do a business deal, or negotiate a business deal, involving the sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets. These deals can include any merger, financing, or acquisition. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy.  In the event of a bankruptcy, reorganization, or other application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditorsâ rights, however, we may not be able to control the use, transfer, or treatment of your personal information.</p>
      <p>6.11 Aggregated and/or Anonymized Data.  We may also share aggregated and/or anonymized data with others for their own uses.</p>
      <p>7 How You Can Change or Remove Information</p>
      <p>7.1 Editing your Profile. You may change or remove your profile information at any time by going to your profile page and applying the tools there. Information should be updated promptly. If it is not, please let us know.</p>
      <p>7.2 Deactivating or Deleting your Account. If you want to stop using your account, you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We may save your profile information in case you later decide to reactivate your account. A user may deactivate his or her account for temporary reasons until they may return to the Site and related services. If we have not deleted your information and Content, you will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from CardinalHire. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it.</p>
      <p>7.3 Limitations on Removal. After you remove information or Content or delete your account, copies of that information and Content you posted may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed, or it was copied or stored for archive or backup purposes or by other users. Nonetheless, your name will no longer be associated with that information on the Site. Additionally, we may retain certain information to prevent identity theft and other misconduct and for other legitimate business reasons even if deletion has been requested. If you have given third-party applications or Internet websites access to your information, they may retain your information to the extent permitted under the respective terms of service or privacy policies. Even so, they will no longer be able to access the information through our platform after you disconnect from them.</p>
      <p>7.4 Backup Copies. Removed and deleted information and Content may persist in backup copies, but will not be made available by us to third parties.</p>
      <p>7.5 Opt-Out.  Our Site functions or marketing emails tell you how to âopt-outâ from receiving marketing emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you.</p>
      <p>8 How We Protect Information</p>
      <p>We endeavor to keep your information secure, but we need your help.</p>
      <p>8.1 Steps We Take To Keep Your Information Secure. We may use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of Site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our TOS.</p>
      <p>8.2 Risks Inherent In Sharing Information and Content. No security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information and Content. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information and Content. We cannot ensure that information and Content you share on the Site will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for hacking or other third-party circumvention of any privacy or security measures on CardinalHire. You can reduce these risks by using common-sense security practices, such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up-to-date anti-virus software.</p>
      <p>8.3 Report Violations. You should report any security violations to us via this <%= link_to 'contact page', welcome_contact_path %>.</p>
      <p>9 Miscellany</p>
      <p>9.1 Consent To Collection And Processing In The United States. By using CardinalHire, you consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States of America.</p>
      <p>9.2 California Residents. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to request certain information from a business regarding its disclosure of the customerâs personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to make such a request, send an e-mail with "California Privacy Request" in the subject heading to the privacy email address on this <%= link_to 'contact page', welcome_contact_path %> and we will be in further contact with you.</p>
      <p>9.3 Defined Terms. Defined terms have the same meaning as the General Terms of Service unless otherwise limited by the context.</p>
